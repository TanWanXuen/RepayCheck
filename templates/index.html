        <h2>What is Loan Repayment Eligibility?</h2>
        <p class="carousel-summary">
            Loan repayment eligibility refers to your ability to repay a loan based on your financial situation — including your income, loan amount, interest rate, and credit score.
            Lenders assess this to ensure that borrowers can meet their monthly payments without financial distress. At <strong>RepayCheck</strong>, we use advanced machine learning models trained on real-world data to help you estimate your likelihood of successful repayment.
