        <summary>Frequently Asked Questions</summary>

        <br><strong>Q: What is this tool based on?</strong><br>
        A: This tool is powered by machine learning model trained on anonymized financial datasets. It uses selected attributes like payment history, debt usage, and loan type to assess repayment behavior, with fairness adjustments applied.

        <br><br><strong>Q: Do I need to fill in every field?</strong><br>
        A: No. Fields marked as optional can be left blank. If skipped, default or average values will be used in their place. You can still receive a prediction.

        <br><br><strong>Q: What if I receive a “Not Eligible to Repay” result?</strong><br>
        A: This result suggests possible repayment risk based on the inputs provided. It does not reflect any actual credit approval or rejection. You may adjust your information to explore how certain factors affect the prediction.

        <br><br><strong>Q: Can I trust the fairness of the result?</strong><br>
        A: Yes. This system integrates fairness techniques (pre-, in-, and post-processing) to reduce bias toward specific demographic groups, using attributes such as regional data as a proxy for socioeconomic fairness.

        <br><br><strong>Q: Is this tool affiliated with any official financial institution?</strong><br>
        A: No. RepayCheck is developed as part of a final-year research project and is not associated with any bank, lender, or government agency.

        <summary>What is a credit score?</summary>
        <p>
            A credit score is a numerical estimate of a person's creditworthiness, generally ranging from 300 to 850. Lenders use it to assess the risk of granting a loan. Higher scores typically suggest better repayment reliability.

        <summary>How is your estimated score calculated?</summary>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Payment History:</strong> Late or missed payments may lower your score.</li>
            <li><strong>Debt Usage:</strong> A high ratio of used credit compared to your limit is considered risky.</li>
            <li><strong>Credit Age:</strong> A longer and stable credit history usually reflects positively.</li>
            <li><strong>New Credit:</strong> Multiple recent applications or new accounts may reduce your score.</li>
            <li><strong>Credit Mix:</strong> A diverse mix of credit types (e.g., loans, credit cards) is favorable.</li>
        </ul>
